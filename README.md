# Things-to-do
Google, yahoo always return everything under the sun in results except what you need.
I would like to use google api's and services but fine tuned.
I would like  to design a Things to do "now" app for a specific domain (http://seek4free.com) that return real results.
Right now we have to manually app pages for "best of""things to do" and others. I would like to stop the manual process and get a live update with a live web crawler according to the users location. The user in california does not need florida information!
Example searches:
a. "jazz music tonight", the app will search by distance or city, and return links to websites and phone numbers to non website venues.
b. "Best mexican food" same behavior as above, return only website, due to unknown small taco stands.
c. a star rating review only no comments and only one vote per phone ip.

Things to overcome:
I don't want another yelp engine/algorithms or googles, I want exact search or nothing, if you type jazz music in yelp app or google you get sponsored links and thumbnails depending on search keywords. I want to assist with keyword searches in the code to get 10 links or 5 links what ever is relevent.

I'm playing with python right now scrubing code and it works pretty nice for one website. I guess I would need some backend add websites to scrape as they change even scan daily and cache the results for fast returns.
This is a brain storming README, will change as I play with my code.
