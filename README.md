# Things-to-do
Google, yahoo always return everything under the sun in results except what you need.
I would like to use google api's and services but fine tuned.
I would like  to design a Things to do "now" app that return real results like:
a. "jazz music tonight", the app will search by distance or city, and return links to websites and phone numbers to non website venues.
b. "Best mexican food" same behavior as above, return only website, due to unknown small taco stands.
c. a star rating review only no comments and only one vote per phone ip.

Things to overcome:
I don't want yelp engine algorithms or google, I want exact search or nothing, if you type jazz music in yelp or google you get sponsored links and thumbnails depending on the city you choose.
